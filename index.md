As you might already know, 
we are looking for an apartment—preferably 2½ or 3 rooms—in the area from Schöneberg to Steglitz. That is where our son Kai will go to school. But before we are getting ahead of ourselves,  let us start with introductions. 

#### Enno
He is the youngest member of the family: 18 months, funny, carefree and these days a big fan of `Auto` and `Wau Wau`. Enno is going to Ingrid's Kindergarten. 

#### Kai
He is our clever 5-yo globetrotter, born in Copenhagen. He is now attending Kita Buddelkiste after stays in Leipzig and Hawaii. 
This summer, Kai will start his school life in Rothenburg-Grundschule, just behind  Rathaus Steglitz.
